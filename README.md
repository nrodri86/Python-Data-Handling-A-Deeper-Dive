Manipulating data is a core part of writing almost any Python program. To represent data, Python provides a small collection of built-in types such as lists, sets, dictionaries, and classes. Additionally, there are useful objects in the standard collections module that are commonly used to solve a variety of data-related problems. Finally, there are third party libraries such as numpy and Pandas that provide additional data handling resources.

In this live training, we’re going to take a deeper look at data representation in Python. Topics will include performance tradeoffs, common programming idioms, and details about Python’s underlying object model.
